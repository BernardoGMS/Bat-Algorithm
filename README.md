This work aims at implementing an algorithm based on a bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization method: the Bat Algorithm. 
Additionally, the goal is to implement a more efficient version of the method, based on the concept of Differential Evolution.
The main objective of implementing this method is its application in minimizing the maximum deformations of sandwich plates with a functional gradient of properties and plates with a layer featuring a functional gradient of properties. 
Additionally, it aims to maximize, for these same plates, the first fundamental frequency in free vibration.
As for the method considered for the purpose of obtaining the functions to be optimized, an algorithm based on meshless methods was implemented, using multiquadric interpolation functions.
Additionally, a parametric study of the algorithm will be conducted on test functions to verify its impact on the obtained results.</td>
